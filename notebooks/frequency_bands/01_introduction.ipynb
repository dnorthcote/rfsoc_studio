    "# Frequency Bands and Transmission Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "This series of notebooks will introduce the Radio Frequency (RF) band, showing the importance of this band through frequencies present in our everyday lives. This will be covered in several parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An introduction to the RF band and a review of an RF transmitter and receiver system.\n",
    "- An exploration of Nyquist Zones, first through Nyquist sampling rates before seeing how the exploitation of aliasing allows us to work with frequencies greater than $\\frac{f_{s}}{2}$.\n",
    "- An overview of the RF Spectrum, noting relevant frequencies in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd Nyquist Zones and beyond. \n",
    "- An introduction to tranmission safety, exploring which bands are safe to transmit on and which should be avoided. This notebook covers the licensed and license-exempt spectrum as well touching on environmental concerns which should be kept in mind when transmitting. "
