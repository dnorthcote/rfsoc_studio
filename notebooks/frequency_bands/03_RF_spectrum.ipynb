    "Useable radio frequencies for communications start at the low kHz, with AM radio appearing around 600 kHz to 1800 kHz. FM radio then appears from around 88 MHz, and the useable RF communication spectrum is all of the way to 10's of GHz (so called mm waves noting the wavelength is indeed of millimetres in length). An overview of the frequency spectrum can be seen in [Figure 1](#fig-1)."

    "With modern ADCs capable of sampling at multiple GHz, the RF frequencies of many wireless bands can be directly digitised. For example, with 4 GHz sampling, signals in the 1st Nyquist Zone (i.e. 0 to 2 GHz) can be digitised in the conventional manner. With an RFSoC, signals in the 2nd Nyquist Zone can also be captured by exploiting aliasing, provided that an appropriate bandpass filter first removes any components present at other frequencies. Indeed, the 3rd Nyquist Zone and higher can also be used in the same way - provided that suitable analogue filtering is applied."
